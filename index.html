      <img class="bio-image" src="" alt="Kong Le">

      <p>My name is Kong Le and I was born in Vietnam. I moved to America with my family when I was 6 years old. Within a couple years I earned one of the top spots having the highest math score in my school. As I grew up I started taking interests in music and art. I build on my creative side by drawing, painting, and playing the piano. I was good at everything I do. I enjoyed them but they weren't my passion.</p>
      <p>In high school I took an interest in programming. I started to learn the fundamentals of programming by drawing lines and dots on a programmable calculator to make a picture. I took a web design class but it only showed me how to build a webpage through drag and drop. Once I was done I was able to view what the code was for that particular page. However, I could not understand this "foreign" language. I went to college to learn more about it but that wasn't enough to fulfill my dream of being a programmer. So I finally decided to sign up for the UCF coding bootcamp.</p>
